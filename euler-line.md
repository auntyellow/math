**Euler line** is a line passing through othocenter *H* (blue), nine-point center *N* (red), centroid *G* (orange) and circumcenter *O* (green), while *HN* = *NO* and *HG* = 2*GO*. <sup>[1]</sup>

Put *AB* onto x-axis and *C* onto y-axis and set coordinates as *A*(-*a*, 0), *B*(*b*,0), *C*(0,*c*), where *a*, *b* and *c* are positive numbers, then we get all vertices and centers:

So it's easy to prove that *HNGO* are collinear and *HN* = *NO* and *HG* = 2*GO*.

The incenter, however, doesn't lie on the Euler line, unless the triangle is isosceles. The proof (incenter lies on Euler line â†’ isosceles) is not as easy as because we should prove *AB* = *AC* or *AB* = *BC* or *AC* = *BC*.
