## Brute force math problem solving

These problems may have smart solutions with difficult skills. However, I'd like to solve them by brute force: [Proof by Exhaustion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_exhaustion) for number and graph problems; Trigonometric or Analytic Geometry for geometry problems.
