## Brute force math problem solving

These problems may have smart solutions with difficult skills. However, I'd like to solve them by brute force: either [Proof by Exhaustion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_exhaustion) (for number and graph problems) or [Analytic Geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry) (for geometry problems).
