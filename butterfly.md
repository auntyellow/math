The [diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Butterfly_theorem.svg) from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_theorem) is wrong because M is not the midpoint of PQ and XY.

Here we use the diagram from [Mathoman's website](http://www.mathoman.com/de/index.php/1529-verschiedene-sehnen-in-einem-kreis):

The **butterfly theorem** can be stated as: Let M be the midpoint of a chord AB of a circle, through which two other chords PQ and RS are drawn; PS and QR intersect chord AB at C and D correspondingly. Then M is the midpoint of CD.

The theorem can be generalized in two ways:

1. Change the circle to any conic curve;
2. Change the condition *MA* = *MB* and *MC* = *MD* to 1/*MA* - 1/*MB* = 1/*MC* - 1/*MD*.

### Proof by Analytic Geometry

We put *M* onto the origin of Cartesian coordinates and *B* onto positive x-axis.

Here we prove the generalized form 1 so the conic curve *APRBQS* can be represented as:
