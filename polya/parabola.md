The problem is in section **Definition** in *How to Solve It*:

> Construct the point of intersection of a given straight line and a parabola which the focus and the directrix are given.

This is a [Straightedge and Compass Construction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straightedge_and_compass_construction) problem. Although it is impossible to construct a parabola by straightedge and compass, the points of intersection can be found:

> Construct a point *P* on the given straight line *c* at equal distances from the given point *F* and the given straight line *d*.

However, the solution is not given in this book. I'd like to give an analytic geometry solution, which can be converted to straightedge and compass construction.
