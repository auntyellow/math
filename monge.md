These two theorems can be easily proved by Euclidean geometry. However, here we use coordinate approach to cover these cases:

- The intersections of two circles may be imaginary points, but there exists a straight line passing through them.
- The tangent lines to two circles may be imaginary lines, but there intersection point is real.

### Radical Center

The radical line of two circles can be defined as the straight line passing through their intersections, whatever their intersections are real or imaginary.

The radical lines of three circles are concurrent. <sup>[1]</sup>

Let's denote these three circles as:

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\begin{cases}Q_1:x^2+y^2+ax+by+c=0\\Q_2:x^2+y^2+dx+ey+f=0\\Q_3:x^2+y^2+gx+hy+j=0\end{cases}">

Then the three radical lines are:

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\begin{cases}q_2q_3:(d-g)x+(e-h)y+(f-j)=0\\q_3q_1:(g-a)x+(h-b)y+(j-c)=0\\q_1q_2:(a-d)x+(b-e)y+(c-f)=0\end{cases}">

They are obviously concurrent because their determinant of coefficients is zero:
