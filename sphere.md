### Intersection of tangent planes

> A sphere with center on the plane of the face *ABC* of a tetrahedron *SABC* passes through *A*, *B* and *C*, and meets the edges *SA*, *SB*, *SC* again at *A*<sub>1</sub>, *B*<sub>1</sub>, *C*<sub>1</sub>, respectively. The planes through *A*<sub>1</sub>, *B*<sub>1</sub>, *C*<sub>1</sub> tangent to the sphere meet at a point *O*. Prove that *O* is the circumcenter of the tetrahedron *SA*<sub>1</sub>*B*<sub>1</sub>*C*<sub>1</sub>. <sup>[1]</sup>

### Eight vertices of a hexahedron lie on a sphere

> If seven vertices of a (quadrilaterally-faced) hexahedron lie on a sphere, then so does the eighth vertex. <sup>[2]</sup>
